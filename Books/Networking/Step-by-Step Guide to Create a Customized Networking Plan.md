## Step 5: Schedule Consistent Check-Ins

Build consistency into your networking efforts.  

- **Plan**:  
  - Weekly: Spend 30 minutes engaging with your connections (e.g., liking/commenting on LinkedIn posts).  
  - Monthly: Send one email or message to reconnect with key contacts.

## Step 7: Evaluate and Adjust

Periodically review your plan and refine it.  

- **Questions to Reflect On**:  
  - Are you meeting your goals?  
  - Are your current platforms effective?  
  - Do you need to diversify your approach (e.g., attend different events or target different industries)?  

- **Example Adjustment**:  
  - If LinkedIn hasn’t yielded many responses, try attending more in-person events or joining a niche online community.
