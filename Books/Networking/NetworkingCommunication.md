## Strategies for Authentic Networking

### 1. Personalize Every Interaction
- **Why it works**: People respond better when they feel you’ve taken time to tailor your message.  
- **How**: Mention specific details about the person’s work, achievements, or interests.  
  - **Example**:  
    - Instead of: “Hi, I’d like to connect and discuss your work.”

### 2. Use a Conversational Tone
- **Why it works**: A casual, conversational style makes your message feel more natural.  
- **How**: Avoid overly formal or robotic language.  
  - **Example**:  
    - Instead of: “I would like to leverage your insights regarding software engineering.”  
    - Say: “I’ve been following your work, and I’m curious—how did you approach [specific challenge]?”

### 3. Keep It Short and Clear
- **Why it works**: Busy professionals appreciate concise messages that get to the point.

## Key Pointers to Avoid Sounding Like AI

1. **Avoid Overusing Buzzwords**

   - **Email**: More structured but still approachable.  
   - **In-person**: Conversational and open.
